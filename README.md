No configuration is needed as this addon will work out-of-the-box. Simply install it to your Interface/Addons folder.

GatherLevels will display difficulty specific (color coded) profession skill level requirements for Mining and Herbing nodes in game as well as on the minimap.
It will also show Skinning level requirements for all beasts when hovering on their corpses.
Additionally it will display lockpicking skill requirements on lockboxes for rogues.

Note: This addon is optimized for the TurtleWoW client (private server) but it will work for some older and newer builds of the game as well, in order to resolve any compatibility errors simply update the first line (Interface build number) in the GatherLevels.toc file to your relevant build.
