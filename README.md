No configuration is needed as this addon will work out-of-the-box. Simply install it to your Interface/Addons folder.

Note: This addon is optimized for the TurtleWoW client (private server) but it will work for some older and newer builds of the game as well, in order to resolve any compatibility errors simply update the first line (Interface build number) in the GatherLevels.toc file to your relevant build.
